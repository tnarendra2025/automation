Based on the error logs, the main issue appears to be a certificate error when trying to access https://hyperdrive-qa.aexp.com/. The specific error is:

Copy
Error: page.goto: net::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID at https://hyperdrive-qa.aexp.com/
This indicates that the SSL certificate for the QA environment is not trusted by the test runner. Here are some potential solutions:

Bypass SSL Certificate Verification (for testing purposes only):

javascript
Copy
await page.goto("https://hyperdrive-qa.aexp.com/", { 
  waitUntil: "load",
  timeout: 60000,
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true
});
Configure Playwright to trust the certificate:

If you have access to the certificate, you can configure Playwright to trust it

Add this to your playwright config:

javascript
Copy
use: {
  ignoreHTTPSErrors: true
}
Install the certificate on the test runner:

If this is a corporate environment, you may need to install the company's root certificate on the GitHub runner

Environment-specific solution:
Since this is an American Express internal system (aexp.com), you might need to:

Contact your internal IT/security team for the proper certificate

Use a pre-configured runner image that already has the corporate certificates installed

Check if there's an internal proxy or VPN that needs to be configured
