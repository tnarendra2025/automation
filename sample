# Adding Certificates to Playwright Tests in GitHub Actions

Based on your workflow and the issues in the logs, you need to properly configure certificates for your Playwright tests running in your corporate environment. Here's how to modify your workflow to handle certificates:

## Updated Workflow with Certificate Configuration

```yaml

    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

          # Configure Playwright to use system certificates
          export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
          npx playwright test acmRegistrationPage.spec.js \
            --config=playwright.config.js \

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Certificate Configuration**:
   - Added `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` environment variable pointing to system certificates
   - Added step to install `ca-certificates` package and update certificates

2. **System Dependencies**:
   - Explicitly installed all required system dependencies that were showing as missing in your logs

3. **npm Certificate Configuration**:
   - Set `cafile` in npm config to use your corporate CA certificates
   - Enabled `strict-ssl` to ensure certificate validation

4. **Playwright Test Execution**:
   - Added environment variable for certificate configuration before running tests
   - Added explicit reporter configuration

## Additional Recommendations:

1. **Create a `playwright.config.js`** file if you don't have one, with proper proxy settings:
```js
// playwright.config.js
const config = {
  use: {
    // Configure HTTP proxy if needed
    // proxy: {
    //   server: 'http://proxy-appgw.aexp.com:9090'
    // },
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: false // Set to true only for testing if certificate issues persist
  }
};
module.exports = config;
```

2. **If you still encounter certificate issues**, you might need to:
   - Add your corporate root certificate to the system trust store
   - Or temporarily set `ignoreHTTPSErrors: true` in Playwright config (not recommended for production)

3. **For the Allure reporter issue**, I've added the installation of `allure-playwright` package. If you're not using Allure reports, remove the reporter from the test command.

This configuration should resolve the certificate-related issues while maintaining security in your corporate environment.
